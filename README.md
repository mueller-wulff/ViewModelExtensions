# View Model Extensions

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/mueller-wulff/ViewModelExtensions.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#mueller-wulff/ViewModelExtensions)

This is a small collection of helper classes/methods to simplify the usage of `ViewModel` in kotlin projects.

Usage
-----

When getting a `ViewModel` from `ViewModelProviders` you generally have to write:

```kotlin
ViewModelProviders.of(fragment)[T::class.java]
```

and when you want to have a custom `ViewModelProvider.Factory` it gets even more convoluted:

```kotlin
ViewModelProviders.of(fragment, object: ViewModelProvider.Factory {
    override fun <T : ViewModel?> create(modelClass: Class<T>): T {
        //create ViewModel based on the supplied modelClass
    }
})[T::class.java]
```

instead you can use easy-to-use property delegate inside a `ComponentActivity` or `Fragment`:

```kotlin
val model: MyViewModel by viewModels()
```

or when you want to use a custom `ViewModel` with a non-empty constructor:

```kotlin
val model: MyViewModel by viewModelsCustom { MyViewModel("a string", 12) }
```

When working with `LiveData` it is always a hassle to check for nullable value. 
This library adds some methods to get non-null values:

```kotlin
model.test.observeRequired(this) { test -> 
    //test is not null
}

val test: Test = model.test.requireValue() //test is not null
```

**NOTE**: This does not prevent you from setting `null` on a `LiveData`. When using a 
`require`-method on a `LiveData` that holds a `null` value, an exception is thrown.

Events
------

When wanting to publish events as live data, there is a problem when multiple observers register to 
the same `LiveData`, because normal `LiveData` does not regulate consuming of events. 

There is a solution presenting by Jose Alcérreca on Medium
(find it [here](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/livedata-with-snackbar-navigation-and-other-events-the-singleliveevent-case-ac2622673150))
, where a new Event class is introduced to regulate consuming of events.

This `Event` class is now available as part of this library, simply define a `LiveData` of an `Event`:

```kotlin
private val _warning = liveDataOf<Event<String>>()
val warning = _warning.asLiveData()
```

and then you can consume the event in the activity or fragment of you choice:

```kotlin
model.warning.observe(this) { event ->
    event?.getContentIfNotHandled()?.let {
        Toast.makeText(this, it, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }
}
```

this will guarantee that the event is only consumed once.

Utility Methods
---------------

To create a `MutableLiveData` object you can use the `mutableLiveDataOf` function. 
You can turn any `MutableLiveData` into a `LiveData` using the `asLiveData` function:

```kotlin
private val _number = mutableLiveDataOf(5)
val number = _number.asLiveData()
```

When using a `AndroidViewModel` there is now an extension property to access the `application` 
without using the getter.

When wanting to transform `LiveData` with [Transformations](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/Transformations)
you can now use an extension method like:

```kotlin
private val _number = liveDataOf(5)
val number = _number.asLiveData()

val numberMultitude = number.map { it * 25 }
```

Installation
------------

add jitpack to repositories.

top-level build.gradle
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

add ViewModelExtensions to application build.gradle
```groovy
implementation 'com.github.mueller-wulff:ViewModelExtensions:1.7.0'
```
